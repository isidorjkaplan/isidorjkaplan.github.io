## About Me

I am a second-year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto with a particular interest in machine learning, programming and software-design. I am on the dean’s list for all of my academic terms to date and a recipient of the University of Toronto Scholars Award and the FASE First Year Summer Fellowship. I worked for the iQua research group during the summer of 2020 to write 3 research papers on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Work

After completing first year I took a summer internship with the [iQua Research Group](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu) were I helped design and apply deep reinforcement learning algorithms under the supervision of Prof. Baochun Li within the context of networking problems, such as congestion control, edge computing and network-adaptive coding.

## Projects

* **High School**: Implemented a large 300+ class gaming plugin in Java during high school as a CS project which I then sold online at a substantial profit
* **Engineering Strategies and Practices**: Reached out to industry connections to bring machine learning project for METSCO Power Inc to Engineering Strategies and Practices course; led team on design project. First student (10+ years) to take initiate and bring their own project to the course.
* **First year programming course**: Implemented an Alpha-GO inspired Machine Learning algorithm for board game Reversi. Received certificate for program ranking within top 10 in the class of 300+ students.

## Awards 
* Recipient of the **University of Toronto Scholars Award** in 2020-21 academic year
* Recipient of the FASA (Faculty of Applies Science) **First Year Summer Fellowship**
* **Dean’s List** for all academic terms to date
